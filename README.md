# Learn-GPU

## Welcome to my GPU programming journey!

### This repository is a log for my progress as I dive into the fascinating world of parallel computing and GPU programming. The goal is project-based learning - each folder contains a project that I worked on to understand some new concepts (CUDA for now, maybe OpenCL later!).
